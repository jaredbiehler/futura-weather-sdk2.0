Weather My Way (Pebble SDK 2.0)
=================================

![pebble banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaredbiehler/weather-my-way/master/screenshots/pebble-banner.png)

This is my attempt at learning about the Pebble SDK by adjusting an app for my own needs. The original Futura Weather watchface was the cleanest and best looking design I had seen but I prefer YAHOO! Weather data. So, I added the option to switch between both, and added hourly data from Weather Underground. 

* Update - as of 2016, Yahoo has decided to charge for API access when attempting to translate lat lon to woeid and therefor I have replaced their API with Weather Underground. 

Give it a shot and let me know what you think: [download pbw here](https://github.com/jaredbiehler/weather-my-way/releases/)

## Requirements

The hourly data for this app comes from the [Weather Underground API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/). Unfortunately, their API is not free. However, Weather Underground does provide a free developer API key (500 hits / day) which more than suffices for this app. Don't share your API key, as once the quota has been reached the key will stop working. 

## Configuration 

[Try it yourself here](http://jaredbiehler.github.io/weather-my-way/config/)

 Query string variables: 
```
s=[wunder|open]  // weather service
u=[F|C]         // weather scale
d=[true|false]  // debug enabled
b=[on|off]      // battery enabled
a=[apikey]      // Weather Underground API Key 
```

## Progress
 - Hourly weather! 
 - Configurable weather provider (Weather Underground, Open Weather map)
  - More granularity in weather condition expression 
 - Configurable minimal battery display
 - Configurable weather scale (°F / °C)
 - Configurable debug mode ((L)ast updated, (P)ublish Date, Neighborhood)
 - JQuery Mobile configuration screen [here](http://jaredbiehler.github.io/weather-my-way/config/)
 - Config settings are persisted 
 - No longer subscribed to second ticks, minute & day for better battery performance
 - Tested on iOS 7.1 & Android 4.3
 - Improved network link monitoring (limited retries on both Pebble and JS sides)
 - many rewrites, separation of concerns
